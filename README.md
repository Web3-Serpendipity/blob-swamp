# Come on into the blob-swamp


## Basic Concept

You are born as a lowly, tiny, single-celled organism... but through the power of gluttony, you can become an enormous single celled organism!

To start, you may be born (as above) and work your way up to glory like any respectable cell. Or you may buy into someone else's success. Each cell is minted as an NFT. As such you are free to buy or sell this NFT. 


## Smart contract

The smart contract is relevant at the beginning and end of a round. A new blob must be 
- minted,
- skinned (optional) 
- connected to the server
- payouts at the end of the round/month.
