# Come on into the blob-swamp


## Basic Concept

You are born as a lowly, tiny, single-celled organism... but through the power of gluttony, you can become an enormous single celled organism!


## Smart contract

The smart contract is relevant at the beginning and end of a round. A new blob must be 
- minted,
- skinned (optional 
- connected to the server
- payouts at the end of the round/month.


## Client/Server JS - Reimplementation of agar-type game.

Single server that runs the game for everyone
client js that connects to eth and the central server (websocket)
